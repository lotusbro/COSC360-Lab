# Lab 1: Overview and Rubric

In this lab, you will have to opportunity to practice building a static HTML5 site. The goal is to build a site as follows using the relevant information. Your site should look like the image included on the last page of the lab. Notes relating to the required elements are shown along the left hand side. Detailed instructions follow. Review the marking rubric to ensure you have addressed all points required for the page. Ensure you keep a version on your page under version control with GitHub Classroom as it will be graded from this location and used in subsequent weeks. You do not need to use a webserver for
this lab. You can open the file directly with your web browser on your local machine.
