# Lab 5: JavaScript

In this assignment, you will have the opportunity examine form validation, security and tag highlight helper with JavaScript.  Detailed instructions follow.  Review the marking rubric to ensure you have addressed all points required for the page.  Ensure you keep a version on your pages under version control as it may be used in subsequent weeks.  You do not need to use a webserver to host your page for this lab.  **Do not modify the HTML code.  You will need to inspect the source code to determine how to link your JavaScript to the page**.
