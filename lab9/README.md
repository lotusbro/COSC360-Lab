# Lab 9: Database and Data Storage with PHP

In this lab, you will to explore how to connect a MySQL database to a web page with PHP as well as validating passwords with JavaScript. It will provide an overview of how data can be exchanged between a browser and server to generate and handle dynamic content. The goal is to thoroughly study the code examples and experiment with them in order to understand the underlying concepts.

**This lab is longer that previous labs.  Start early so that any issues with your database can be resolved before the due date.** 

**As you are now working with server-side scripting, a server will be required.  You will need to use a webserver to host your page for this lab.**
